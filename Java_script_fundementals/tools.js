//transpilers and bundlers
//transpilers convert code from one version of a language to another, such as from ES6 to ES5
//this is useful for ensuring compatibility with older browsers that may not support the latest features of JavaScript
//Babel is a popular transpiler that can convert modern JavaScript code into a version that is compatible with older environments
//Bundlers like Webpack and Rollup
//typescript is a superset of javascript that adds static types
//typescript code is transpiled to javascript before it can be run in a browser or Node.js
//Bundlers like Webpack and Rollup take all your JavaScript files and their dependencies and
